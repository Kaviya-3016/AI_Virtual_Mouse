 üñ±Ô∏è AI Virtual Mouse using Hand Gestures

Transform your hand gestures into mouse actions using computer vision and AI!  
This intelligent system enables touchless control of your computer using just a webcam ‚Äî ideal for accessibility solutions, smart classrooms, or futuristic computing.

## üöÄ Overview

The **AI Virtual Mouse** is a gesture-controlled interface that replaces traditional mouse input with real-time hand tracking. Using a combination of OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, the project interprets finger positions and movements to control the mouse cursor and perform click actions ‚Äî making Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) more intuitive.

## üéØ Features

‚úÖ Real-time hand tracking via webcam  
‚úÖ Cursor control using index finger movement  
‚úÖ Left click action by pinching index and middle finger  
‚úÖ Smooth, lag-free gesture response  
‚úÖ Adjustable screen mapping for any resolution  
‚úÖ Runs locally on your PC ‚Äî no internet required
